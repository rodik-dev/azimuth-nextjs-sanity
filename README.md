The theme can be used to create a static website and hosted by a serverless
deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The contents of
the site are stored in [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) Headless CMS and
provided to the built script at the build time. Once site has been built and
deployed, it does not call any API requests, all pages are pre-rendered and
hosted via CDN.

In addition, Next.js [SSG support](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support)
has been leveraged to support client side rendering when navigating the internal
links of the site.

[Sourcebit](https://github.com/stackbithq/sourcebit) and its plugins, specifically
[`sourcebit-source-sanity`](https://github.com/stackbithq/sourcebit-source-sanity)
and [sourcebit-target-next](https://github.com/stackbithq/sourcebit-target-next),
are used to fetch and normalize the data from Sanity and provide it to Next.js
pages. It also sets up live updates in development mode allowing to update the
content in CMS and instantly see them in browser.

## Editing Content

Once Stackbit creates a site, you can start editing the content using the free
on-page editing experience provided by the [Stackbit Studio](https://stackbit.com?utm_source=project-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=user_themes).

## Develop Locally

1. [Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/azimuth-nextjs-sanity&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

1. Stackbit will create a new GitHub repository, a [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) project, and deploy the site via the selected serverless deployment platform (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)).

1. Once finished, you will be redirected to Stackbit Studio where you will be
   able to edit the content using the free on-page editing experience, and
   publish new versions of your site.

1. To further develop your site, clone the generated repository.

1. Install dependencies

       run npm install

1. Optionally, run Sanity Studio locally by installing sanity-cli, and then installing and running the studio from the `/studio` directory. You may be required to login with the Sanity CLI.

        npm install -g @sanity/cli
        cd studio
        sanity login
        sanity install
        sanity start

1. Set the following environment variables locally.

   - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` - Sanity project ID (you can copy it from the `api.projectId` key in [studio/sanity.json](studio/sanity.json))
   - `SANITY_DATASET` - Sanity dataset name (optional, default is `production`)
   - `SANITY_TOKEN` - Sanity read-write token (you can copy it from the "environment" section in your Netlify site https://app.netlify.com/sites/<netlify-site-name>/settings/deploys#environment)

1. Start the Gatsby local development server (run from project root):

        npm run dev

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.
   You can now edit the site contents in the local Sanity Studio, and the
   browser will live-update your changes. üéâ


## Contributing üôè

To contribute to this theme please follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repository locally

1. Install Sanity CLI

        npm install -g @sanity/cli

1. Login into Sanity

        sanity login

1. Install dependencies

        npm install

1. Create an empty Sanity project, and a "production" dataset (this just creates
   a project)

        node sanity-export/create-project.js
        
        > creating a project...
        > created a project, projectId: dgaiu42f
        > creating a dataset...
        > created a dataset

1. Copy paste the projectId from previous step and import the content to the project

        node sanity-export/import.js <project_id>

1. Replace the `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` in [studio/sanity.json](studio/sanity.json)
   with your Sanity project id

1. Install and start local Sanity Studio

        cd studio
        sanity install
        sanity start

   Sanity studio is now available at http://localhost:3333

1. Define following environment variables to allow Sourcebit to fetch the content
   from Sanity when developing or building the site. You will need to create a
   "read-write" token in your Sanity project settings page 
   (https://manage.sanity.io/projects/__PROJECT_ID__/settings/api)

       export SANITY_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
       export SANITY_DATASET=production
       export SANITY_TOKEN=<read_write_token>

1. Lastly, run the development server (from project folder):

        npm run dev

    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.
    You can now edit the site contents in the local Sanity Studio, and the
    browser will live-update your changes.

1. Once you finish updating the code and contents, export the contents
   back to sanity-export/export.json by running

        node sanity-export/export.js <project_id>

1. Set back the `"projectId": "SANITY_PROJECT_ID"` in [studio/sanity.json](studio/sanity.json)

1. Commit, push and submit a pull-request üéâ


## Building for production üèó

To build a static site for production, run the following command

    npm run build

The exported site will be written to `out` folder. The contents of this folder 
can be deployed by serverless deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
